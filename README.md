# symfony-git-hooks
Collection of git hooks, used in symfony projects

Motivation
----------
This project was inspired by a copy&paste solution of different projects and by other existing projects which were some kind of overkill (https://packagist.org/packages/bruli/php-git-hooks), very specialized (https://github.com/partnermarketing/pm-git-hooks-php) or too configurable (https://github.com/aequasi/git-hook-handler).

The goal is to build a package, than can be installed automatically in no time and will do just 2-3 simple checks.
